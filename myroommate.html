<h1> My Roommate Bailee Moody-Kay </h1>

<h2> This is my roommate Bailee. We met on the facebook page and started talking through there.
We found we had a lot in common and decided to request each for roommates. </h2>

<h4> She is from Patten, Maine, which is around three and a half hours from my hometown, 
so hopefully we will stay in touch throughout the summers and be lifelong friends! </h4>    
   
<h3> I got lucky and we get along very well. A lot of people don't get my sense of humor
and we hit it right off from the beginning. </h3>
